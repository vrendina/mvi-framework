/**
 * When updating values on a remote source and waiting for a response it is often a best practice
 * to update the user interface immediately even though the remote value may not be modified yet.
 * If no response is received from the remote source within a certain time the user interface should be
 * restored to the previous state.
 *
 * A [StateLatch] provides two methods that facilitate this behavior. When the user interacts with the application and
 * changes the state, the user interface should be updated immediately and the [sendState] method should
 * be called to send the updated state to the remote source. Calling [sendState] has several implications:
 *
 * - If [sendState] is called multiple times within the send interval, only the last block of code will be executed.
 * - When [sendState] is called, any state updates that are received will be suppressed until after the restore delay
 * has expired.
 *
 * When a state update is received from the remote source [setState] should be called with the updated value.
 * Calling [setState] may call the listener immediately or after a time interval no greater than the restore delay.
 *
 * - If [sendState] was called was called recently and the restore delay has not expired the listener will
 * be called once the restore delay has expired.
 * - If [sendState] has not been called recently and updates are not suppressed the listener will be called
 * immediately and the user interface should be updated to reflect the new remote state.
 *
 * Note that if no state update is ever received and [setState] has not been called then the listener will not
 * be called after the restore delay because there will be no state value to restore back to.
 *
 * @param restoreDelay Amount of time to wait before restoring the previous state value
 * @param sendInterval Amount of time to wait between sending state updates
 * @param restoreScheduler Scheduler that the listener should be executed on. By default this
 * operates on the Android main thread.
 * @param sendScheduler Scheduler that the state sending lambda should be executed on. By default
 * this operates on the IO scheduler.
 * @param listener Method that will be called when a state update is received or when the
 * state is being restored to the previous value. This listener should be used to update the
 * user interface or call setState {} in your ViewModel to update the view state.
